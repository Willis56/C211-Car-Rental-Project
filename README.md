# C211-Car-Rental-Project

The project will simulate a car rental system.  There will be a java class for Cars, Customers, and Rental Costs.  There will be a main menu for the user to select options to add their customer info, select their car from a list, input number of days for rental,
and checkout.  The checkout will calculate the cost based on the car and the number of days selected
